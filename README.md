# Matrix Determinant Calculator Java Program.
## Calculate determinant of matrices of any order.
* There are many apps online which calculate the determinant but they are limited to size of matrices upto (100 x 100) or (1000 x 1000). These apps use mathematical methods like Laplace's formula, Sylvester's determinant theorem, Cramer's rule, etc.
* I have designed a recursive algorithm which can be used with matrix of any size.
* I have tested this algorithm for size = (10,000 x 10,000) on random numbers and it ran without any error and was executed in about 15 seconds(intel i5).

## How to use?
* Run the file in Java.
* Node web app version - 'https://github.com/redb17/Matrix-Determinant-Calculator-Web-App'.
